User101: This app is fantastic. The variable parameters provides hours of fun. It feels like i’m playing a brand new mandolin every time! 5/5

appMaster97: This app is extremely intuitive and completely bug free. The ability to swap between strum and tap mode is brilliant and it makes learning mandolin easy with the ability to see where all the notes are! 6/5
